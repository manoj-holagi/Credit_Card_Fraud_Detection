# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

### To identify online payment fraud with machine learning, we need to train a machine learning model for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. For this, we need a dataset containing information about online payment fraud, so that we can understand what type of transactions lead to fraud. For this task, I collected a dataset ( https://www.kaggle.com/ealaxi/paysim1/download )from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect fraud in online payments. Below are all the columns from the dataset Iâ€™m using here:

### 1. step: represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour
### 2. type: type of online transaction
### 3. amount: the amount of the transaction
### 4. nameOrig: customer starting the transaction
### 5. oldbalanceOrg: balance before the transaction
### 6. newbalanceOrig: balance after the transaction
### 7. nameDest: recipient of the transaction
### 8. oldbalanceDest: initial balance of recipient before the transaction
### 9. newbalanceDest: the new balance of recipient after the transaction
### 10. isFraud: fraud transaction
